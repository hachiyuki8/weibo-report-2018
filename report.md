## Abstract

**Introduction**: According to the official report from Sina Weibo, in 2016 Weibo has dealt with 2330 pieces of false information, whose number decupled in 2017. The frequent appearance of rumors has aroused widespread concern and criticism. This survey was carried out to investigate users' standards of judgement upon seeing information on Weibo and their response to them.	

**Methods**: A questionnaire was designed and distributed on Weibo, which contained 17 questions targeting the respondent's background, their way of judging validity of news and popular science articles on Weibo, their reaction to doubtful information and their feelings about the features of information on Weibo.

**Conclusion**: Users generally believe that information on Weibo has less validity and accuracy than those posted on traditional media, while only 2% of participants would verify the information they have received, and the higher the educational level a user has, the higher is the possibility that they verify and double-check the information; 80%  tend to judge them by common sense and personal knowledge.

## Introduction

Sina Weibo was founded in 2009, and became listed in NASDAQ five years later. Daily active users of Weibo has reached 3.76 hundred million till September 2017, and the number keeps rising. Providing the public with a platform where everyone can share information and communicate, Weibo has become the largest social media in China.

While information posted on weibo enjoys an increasing diversity, the fact that every person is free to share information on Weibo has brought about problems. On August 25th, 2017, Cyberspace Administration of China issued a new provision which required all users of social media to be registered under their real name, without which they cannot post or make comments. 

A series of actions has been taken to strengthen the supervision of online information, whose effect remains to be seen. According to the report published by Weibo Counter-rumor Center, in 2016 Weibo dealt with 2330 pieces of false information; the number increased by ten times in 2017.

The prevalence of the widespread of rumors is noticeable on Weibo. Several weeks earlier, someone posted a weibo with a photo which was claimed to be mirages witnessed in Hangzhou. Thousands of users reposted it, believing in the so-called mirages which were actually just the reflection of sunlight. Although many have left comments to make clarification, few noticed and the number of reposts has kept rising until the original post was proven to be a rumor and deleted. Last month a certified individual user with millions of followers posted a video, claiming that the girl in the video had been kidnapped and trafficked. Since it seemed to be an emergency, the video immediately aroused people's attention and was widely spread in a few hours. It was proven to be false information as well by the official account of local police the second day.

Such cases can be dated back to last year, among which many have casted much larger affect. A certified user posted a message from his follower, in which the writer - a college student studying in Germany - said that she was probably stalked and threatened by a religious cult. The number of reposts reached one million in a few days, and many people who had resources offered help to her. When Chinese Embassy in Germany claimed that no case had been reported to them, people started to notice the questionable points in the message. After a few more days, the writer admitted that she made up the whole story. Until then, the information has been spread to many other platforms, some even foreign, causing severe impact.

From these cases we can see the prevalence of rumors on Weibo. In 2016, researchers from Tsinghua University collected data of 9079 rumors posted during 2011 to 2015 from Weibo Report Center and analyzed them. Results showed that most rumors were reported and clarified one week after posted, while false information related to common knowledge would have several peaks of page views and repost. 

Addressing such phenomena, I conducted this survey to study users' mind behind the spread of online rumors. Details are as follows.


### 1. Objective
This survey aimed at understanding weibo users' standard of judging the validity of online information and their way of dealing with information in order to understand the psychological pattern behind the spread of rumors.


### 2. General situation of the respondents
All respondents are weibo users, most of which are post 90s females.


### 3. Method
The survey was posted and spread online. 327 valid surveys have been collected during July 1st, 2018 to August 31st, 2018.


### 4. Contents
Contents of the survey centered on Weibo users’ standards of judging validity of news and popular science articles on Weibo and users' way of dealing with them.


### 5. Results

#### (1)Basic facts
Among all respondents, post 90s makes up the majority (61%); post 00s ranks the second (23%) while the rest are post-80s or earlier. 60% of the respondents are undergraduates or bachelors, 6% have higher education levels while the rest are reading in or have graduated from middle school or college.

Half of the respondents report themselves as being a very frequent user of Weibo, with less than one-tenth think they use Weibo rather infrequently. 71% of the respondents follow entertainment or sports contents, 61% follow literature or art, 57% follow life-related contents, while less than half follow social issues or science on Weibo (42% and 35%).


#### (2)Standards of judgement
71% of the respondents read news or social issues on Weibo because someone they follow has reposted such contents. By comparison, only half access news through the official accounts of the press. 40% access news from owned media or certified individual users, which is higher from people that do so from Weibo search list (31%) and marketing users (29%).

More than two-thirds of the respondents judge the validity of news based on common sense and personal knowledge (75%), or the authority and reliability of the sources (86%), comparing to 29% that pay attention to the writing style of the information, or whether other platforms have posted same information (25% for online platforms and 31% for offline).

Most people choose the same way they judge the popular science articles they read on Weibo. However 6% claim that they don't care about the validity of these contents, and less than 10 people mention that they will check and verify themselves.


#### (3)Counter-rumors
Most users judge the validity of counter-rumors in the same way. However, compared to how they judge the original news, 61% pay attention to the writing style, which doubles compared to the 29% above.

#### (4) Reactions upon seeing questionable information
When respondents are asked to choose their first reaction to questionable contents, most will see if there are different opinions in the comments or repost list (34%), and 20% will verify them by other means. 23% choose to ignore such information, while 3% repost them regardless of their validity.

As for their way of dealing with questionable information, 36% report that they don't care about any follow-ups. 34% will like the repost or comment that have raised a more convincing opinion, while less will repost (17%) or post (9%) and express their own ideas.

When the people users follow have reposted questionable information, more than half pay no attention to it (54%). 24% of the respondents don’t share what they read on Weibo to their friends, and the rest will share the information online with friends (46%), repost them to other platforms (24%) or tell others about them (40%).


#### (5)Comparison between Weibo and traditional media
In this scale of 1 to 7 (1 means strongly disagree and 7 means strongly agree) it is obvious how respondents generally think of Weibo. Most agree that information on Weibo has stronger timeliness and fits the times more than those on traditional media (the average points being 5.5 and 5.12). At the same time, respondents generally disagree that information on Weibo are better in terms of accuracy.

#### (6)Relation between education level and judgement
Using cross analysis, we can notice a few trends.
First of all, with the rising education level, the percentage of people who choose to verify information increases.

Secondly, as for the factors that influence people's judgement, with the rising education level, people tend to rely more on personal knowledge rather than hot comments or reposts.

### 6. Discussion

#### (1)General Discussion
Looking at the data, we can see that most respondents access news or popular science information from sources other than official accounts, be it owned media or individual users, which makes the authority of source of information inconsistent in different cases. When dealing with information, most people think rationally, relying on common sense, personal knowledge or authority. However, although most respondents tend to deny the validity and accuracy of Weibo information generally, only few would double-check in other platforms and verify the information themselves.

Upon seeing dubious information, a lot pay no attention to its validity, but only few would repost regardless. Still, most tend to look at others' opinion to help themselves make the judgement without doing verification, and even if they do have doubts, most don't care to speak out. The situation is almost the same when it comes to who they followed have reposted dubious information; most will ignore it and will not voluntarily remind others. It shows that although respondents are aware that false information prevails on Weibo, not many take it seriously.

Another fact worth mentioning is that respondents' method of judgement is related to their education level. The higher education level a respondent has, the more willing they will be to make verification instead of relying on others' opinion. Objectively speaking, with higher education levels, one has fewer tendencies to be misled by false information.


#### (2)Research limitation
This survey has several limitations. Firstly, most of the respondents are females, making it hard to tell the difference of ways of dealing with information between two genders, and the final result may have been influenced by characteristics of females' thought. At the same time, most data comes from people in their 20s and 30s, the traits of the young may have influenced the result as well. 

Secondly, most questions are not exclusive, where respondents can choose three answers at most, so we can only see respondents' general attitude toward some issues, with no apparent tendency.


#### (3)Some thoughts
From the data we can observe that although few people spread whatever information they see regardless of its validity, most respondents still judge the information using the easiest way, which is personal knowledge, instead of investigating them through other means. Also, a lot don't care about the dubious information they see, ignoring them under most circumstances. Because of such an attitude, rumors can easily spread.

It's not true to say that people don't mind seeing dubious information being spread. Fact is that a lot believe that they better believe it than not. Using the video of a little girl that was mentioned in the introduction as an example, not all that've reposted it believed it 100%. But in their mind, it wouldn’t hurt to repost it even if it was false information - no actual harm was done - while it would help a lot if the content was indeed real. 

Their motive is out of kindness, but objectively speaking, if people rationally judge or investigate the information they see before they repost under such an attitude, there's a larger possibility that they notice the questionable point about the information, and the spread of rumors can stop before negative consequences occur.

Thus, however, comes another paradox. To what extent should users be cautious with that information on Weibo? Taking the Wushan Child Bride issue as an example, we can see that it's the wide-spread influence of the victim's original post seeking help that make more people learn the fact that was concealed by local authority, being unable to get published in any newspaper. In this way, public opinions are formed online, exerting pressure on whatever party that was trying to cover the truth. Without the influence on weibo, the victim would only have less opportunity to get help. If most people are asking for rigorous proof and stay critical and dubious about every single detail, a lot of social issues may not get enough attention. That's why the subjectivity and tolerance in people's standards of judgement are not always a bad thing, under most circumstances even playing a positive role. So it becomes a serious question requiring careful consideration of both the users and the administrators, which is how to balance the positive and negative effect of such subjectivity.
